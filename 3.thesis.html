        <h2>My PhD Thesis</h2>
        <p>My doctoral thesis is part of the project “Life-course trajectories of abusers and victims of intimate partner violence (DONTHURTME),” led by my supervisor Jorge Rodríguez Menés and funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities (MICINN). The project began in 2018 and culminated in 2020 with a comprehensive dataset of perpetrators and survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Catalonia (Spain).</p>
        <p>Below, you can find the abstract of my first working paper:</p><br>
	<p><b>Victimization trajectories of Intimate Partner Violence</b></p><br>
	<p>Previous literature shows that the risks of intimate partner violence (IPV) and the factors explaining them differ across various types of women over the life course. The objectives of this paper are to identify and describe groups of women based on their lifetime trajectories of IPV victimization, and to estimate the socio-demographic characteristics of both survivors and aggressors. We apply group-based trajectory modeling to a unique longitudinal dataset comprising a full cohort of male aggressors convicted of at least one IPV crime between 2010-2015 (about 7,000) in Catalonia (Spain) and women survivors of such crimes if they were granted a protection order at any point in their lives (about 4,000). The results identify four distinct trajectories of lifetime IPV victimization: a first and a second group victimized at early ages, a third group victimized more likely after forming cohabiting unions, and a fourth group sustainably victimized over the life course.</p>
